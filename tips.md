        20 seconds of easy kiting. Using Sprint when already in combat lowers
        the duration to 10 seconds. Save Sprint for tougher enemies and pull
        weaker ones while waiting on cooldown'
        - 'Leg Graze gives you another 10 seconds of kiting. Try not to overlap
        with Sprint'
        - 'Bind an enemy with Foot Graze to get some extra distance and also
        give yourself some time to heal'

        - 'Use Tactician when you''re going to be taking a couple hits from
        something scary'
        - 'Slowing enemies with Arm''s Length helps too'
    - 'Save burst for tougher enemies if necessary. You can take something down
    much quicker with Reassemble Drill, Turret, Wildfire, and Hypercharge,
    which means it has less time to murder you!'
    - 'Make sure Head Graze is almost ready before opening possible mimics. 7
    seconds left on cooldown is close enough'

## General Tips

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

* Fight in safe places - hallways and rooms that have been cleared
* Always be on the lookout for patrols
  * Be careful opening chests if there are patrols coming in case of mimics
* Never open a silver chest with low HP
* Try to open chests before the exit is open. That way, Mimics will at least
  help to open the exit
* If you're planning to use a Pomander of Rage or Petrification, or Magicite,
  try to check chests first in-case of Mimics
* Know when NOT to open chests - usually this boils down to whether you can
  handle a Mimic, and have time to do so
  * e.g. you've used magicite to clear a floor that has Item Penalty and
    Amnesia enchantments. If you get a Mimic, you will probably need to use a
    Serenity and/or other pomanders to survive
* Be as efficient with your time as possible
  * Always be fighting when possible
  * Kill something weaker while you wait for cooldowns to kill something
    stronger
  * Explore or make your way toward the exit while fighting if possible
  * Watch for nearby enemy movement while fighting, so you know when it's safe
    to run through a room
* First priority in hard levels is clearing a path to the exit. Skip chests if
  they're going to cost too much time or are too risky
* Patrols and proximity agro enemies are usually best to take out first as they
  can cause a lot of trouble and really get in your way

Make sure to check out the [Pomanders section](pomanders.html) for additional
tips related to pomander usage.

## Traps

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

### Avoid Them

This usually means hugging the walls, as traps are **usually** not against the
walls. There are exceptions, however...

#### PotD 111-149

There are some wall traps here, especially in the donut room. Pictures needed

#### PotD 151+

* Dead-end room with the square wall:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_151_1.png' | relative_url }}">
* Dead-end "Stonehenge" room:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_151_2.png' | relative_url }}">

* Room the with blocky wall on the east side can have a trap near the middle of
  the wall. This one seems more rare than the other two. Picture needed

#### HoH 1-29

* The room with narrow strips going to the corners where chests sometimes spawn
  can have traps at the start of these narrow strips, making it impossible to
  collect the chest without hitting the trap:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/hoh_1_1.png' | relative_url }}">
* I'm sure there are some others. Pictures needed
* Some rooms have fences or other items that push you away from the walls, and
  there can be traps along the edges of these

#### HoH 41-79

* In the room with rocks coming out from the four corners, there can be a trap
  on the corner of the rock that sticks out the most. Picture needed

#### HoH 81+

* In the room that has square pits/pools in the corners, making it kind-of "+"
  shaped, there can be a trap along one of the pits. Picture needed

### Survive Them

* Toading/Otter Traps: Hopefully you aren't fighting anything. If you are, try
  to kite, dodge around corners, etc... Stay away from snakes if you're toaded!
* Luring: Not good in the deeper floors!
  * Only the person who hit the trap has agro, so the safest option is to let
    them die if you're in a party.
  * If solo and you're likely to die, make sure you have a Pomander of Raising
    active and die in a safe spot - not in the middle of the room!
  * If trying to fight through
    * Consider popping Pomander of Witching/Steel/Strength/Frailty
    * Try not to use Rage/Petrification/Magicite unless you were already
      planning to
    * Use all of your crowd control abilities - sleep, heavy, bind, etc.
    * Make sure to kill the most dangerous mobs first - especially if they have
      an enrage

### Use Them

* After using a Pomander of Sight, you can use landmines to quickly kill one or
  more enemies. This is particularly useful (and safer!) for tanks. Silver
  chests can be used for the same purpose.
* If you're using a Pomander of Rage, Petrification, or a Magicite, hitting a
  luring trap can give you three extra/quick kills
* If you're going for score, the penalty for hitting a luring trap is less than
  the bonus for killing the three extra enemies

## Treasure Rooms

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

When you see a treasure room, the first thing to do is determine where the exit
is. If it's in or through the treasure room, you're going to have to deal with
it. Your options:

* Fight through. Kill all or some of the enemies, at least until you have a path
  through the room
* Clear quickly with Pomander of Rage, Petrification, or Magicite
  * If you're going to run into the room with Rage, consider using a Safety or
    Sight first
  * Be careful not to agro too much at once when using Rage, as your attacks
    are not very fast and you may die before you can kill everything
* Sacrifice yourself! Use Pomander of Raising and any defensive cooldowns you
  have and run through the room. Try to avoid as much agro as you can and die
  on the other side. This is a very dangerous option - if you die in the middle
  of the room, this will end your run
* HoH only: Use Pomander of Concealing to sneak through. Watch out for
  Rachimonais, Mammoths, or any other enemy that hits you with untelegraphed
  attacks out of combat, as these will break your concealment

Consider using a Pomander of Fortune if you're going to clear the room.

## Hall of Fallacies

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

There is a much higher danger from traps in these big rooms, both because there
are no inner walls that you can hug, and because of possible fake exits.
Hugging the outer wall is safe from traps, but you'll likely need to venture
in to collect chests and get to the exit. The best thing to do is remove all
traps, including fake exits, with a Pomander of Safety.

Alternately, Pomander of Sight will reveal any floor traps, but won't help with
fake exits. Pomander of Concealing will allow you to test the exits - if you
run into an exit don't see the normal transference effect, it is a trap. If you
are concealed, the trap will not be sprung.
