Sharks and Amikiris can rip your head clean off, so look out! There are some
[wall traps](/wall_traps.html#hoh-1-19) to watch out for too.

Floors 1-6 have no bronze chests, and so no mimics. They also do not drop
magicite or pomanders of Alteration, Purity, Serenity, Petrification,
Concealment, and Raising. All of these can be found starting at floor 7,
with the exception of elder magicite, which cannot be found until floor 31.
