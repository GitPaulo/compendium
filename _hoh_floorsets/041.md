Be aware of Sekiban and Mizumimizu enrages, and also the
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#hoh-41-79) on these floors.

Some odd notes about the enemies...

* There are two different enemies named Sekizo - one a patrol, and one not.
  They are both golems, but look different.
* There are two different enemies named Iseki. They are both Maroliths, but one
  is green, and the other is purple.
