You'll likely want to pop Pomanders of Raising and Intuition at the start of
this set, as platinum sacks start to drop here. Do be careful running into the
middle of rooms to collect hoards though, as traps are often deadly here. It's
safest if you've used a pomander of safety, sight, or concealment, or if you're
planning to use a pomander of petrification or a magicite. This is the last set
in which you can find Pomanders of Raising, though they are at an increased
rate.

Watch out for the wraiths' and elbsts' out of combat AoEs as they can one shot
you if you're not paying attention. Mammoths can also cause problems if you're
concealed.

There are a lot of large AoEs in these floors - make sure you're familiar and
know how to avoid or stop them.

Floors 71-73 are known to have a lot of landmines. Tanks especially can use
Pomander of Sight on these floors to take advantage of this.

Be aware of the [wall trap](/wall_traps.html#hoh-41-79) on these floors.
