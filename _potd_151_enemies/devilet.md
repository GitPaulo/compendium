abilities:
  - name: Ice Spikes
    description: 'Causes you to take significant damage whenever you hit the
    enemy; can be interrupted. Recommended to interrupt or disengage
    immediately. The damage can kill you very quickly'
  - name: Void Blizzard
    description: 'Does damage and applies slow; can be interrupted. It only has
    medium range, so you can also run away to avoid it'
notes:
  - 'Disengaging during Ice Spikes and running away to avoid Void Blizzard is
    probably the safest option as you avoid all damage'
  - 'Some people prefer to disengage during Ice Spikes and stun/interrupt Void
    Blizzard. Make sure to disengage again quickly, but you will probably still
    get one autoattack in and take Ice Spikes damage.'
  - 'Can be slowed if transfigured via Pomander of Witching'

    notes:
      - 'Try to stun/interrupt both Ice Spikes and Void Blizzard'

    notes:
      - 'Annoying to fight, so avoid if possible. Not too bad if you''re smart
        about it though'
      - 'Heat Blast recast is not affected by slow, so another option is to
        interrupt Ice Spikes and Hypercharge/Heat Blast away while slowed by
        Void Blizzard'
      - 'Make sure to keep sustaining pots up as kiting won''t help to mitigate
        damage'
