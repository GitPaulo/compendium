      - 'Gold Dust: telegraphed circle AoE'
      - 'Leafstorm: roomwide AoE'
      - 'Boss runs to north end and stays there until after Rotten Stench
      phase'
      - 'Two Deep Palace Hornets adds appear'
      - 'Rotten Stench x3: telegraphed wide line AoE'
  - 'Full rotation takes 56 seconds'
  - 'Kill adds quickly, or they will use Final Sting, which does 70% max HP
  damage (each)'
boss_job_specifics:
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '5m45s with no offensive pomanders (6.0)'
      - '3m45s with strength (6.0)'
    notes:
      - Easy with no poms
  PLD:
    timing:
      - '9m with no offensive pomanders, killing only 1 bee per set (6.0)'
      - '6m15s with strength and 1 lust used to AoE first adds and boss (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Strength recommended'
      - 'Probably best to save Fight or Flight for adds (though boss rotation
      is slightly quicker than recast time)'
      - 'Without strength, you won''t be able to consistently kill both adds.
      Instead, you can kill one and eat Final Sting from the other. Just make
      sure your HP is full for it. The boss will do Acid Mist at the same time,
      allowing you to heal up safely'

Things to watch out for:

* slime enrage
* snakes if you hit a toading trap
* random AoE from Nankas when out of combat

Lots of [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-111-129) here also.
