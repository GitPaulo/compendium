boss_notes:
  - 'Thunderbolt: telegraphed conal AoE'
  - 'Charybdis: telegraphed circle AoE that leaves behind a tornado. Tornado
    periodically expands to double its orignal size, drawing in and damaging
    anyone it catches'
  - 'Trounce: large telegraphed conal AoE. Alternates running to the north or
    south end of the arena to use this'
  - 'Rotation: Thunderbolt &gt; Charybdis x2 &gt; Thunderbolt &gt; Trounce from
    south end &gt; Charybdis x2 &gt; Thunderbolt &gt; Charybdis &gt; Trounce
    from north end &gt; Repeat until 15%'
  - Enters enrage mode at 15% - stands up and casts Ecliptic Meteor dealing 80%
    max HP damage to everyone in the party. Continues to cast this over and over
    until the fight ends
  - 'If you are standing in front of him during meteors, he can also autoattack
    you (so don''t do that!)'
  - 'Most jobs require a very strict strategy to get through this final push.
    See the job-specific notes below'
  - note: 'Useful macros:'
    subnotes:
    - note: 'Cancel Lust: /statusoff "Transfiguration"'
      subnotes:
        - 'Useful if you have trouble clicking it off quickly'
    - note: 'Cancel food: /statusoff "Well Fed"'
      subnotes:
        - 'Again useful if you have trouble cancelling it quickly otherwise'
        - 'Cancelling food is useful during enrage if you''re healing through it
          because Meteors do damage based on your max HP. Lower max HP means less
          damage taken, which means less damage to heal'
        - 'Cancelling your food AFTER the first meteor also acts like a pseudo
          heal since it lowers your max HP, which actually raises your current
          HP%'
    - note: 'Check boss HP% with decimal place: /echo &lt;thpp&gt;'
      subnotes:
        - 'useful so you can get him as close to 15% as possible without
          accidentally starting the burst phase'
boss_job_specifics:
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '7:00 with strength and 1 lust'
    notes:
      - Steel required
      - 'Strength required for the final push, so you may as well have it up
        the entire fight!'
      - Lust also required for the final push
      - 'Keep sustaining pots up 100% and you shouldn''t need to use Second
        Wind or max/super pots until the final push. If you use them, make sure
        the cooldown is over before starting the push'
      - note: 'There are two main strategies used for the burst phase. These
              will be detailed below. The first 85% of the fight is the same
              for both:'
        subnotes:
        - 'Slowly drag him clockwise around the arena, moving a bit each time
          he uses an ability so you''re at the end he''s going to Trounce from.
          This makes Trounce easy to avoid, and tornados are gone before you
          complete a lap'
        - 'Start holding guages at 30% so they can be full for the burst phase'
        - 'At 21%, stop damage, wait until sustaining wears, then pop a fresh
          one, use Tactician, and Lust. Get 5 stacks on the boss, then drop
          Transfiguration immediately (click off or see macro above)'
        - 'Damage him slowly down to 16% and then autoattack only until around
          15.2%. Careful not to hit 15% until you''re ready for the burst
          phase. You can use the macro above for a way to see his HP% with 1
          decimal place'
        - 'If your HP is in good shape, you''re now ready to start the burst
          phase. Choose either the heal or tincture strat below'
      - note: 'Heal strat involves healing after the first meteor so you can
        survive a second one. You must kill the boss before the third meteor
        hits'
        subnotes:
          - note: 'Make sure sustaining doesn''t drop until the second meteor
            hits. If it does, use another RIGHT AWAY. You can afford to clip
            Heat Blast. You cannot afford to miss regen ticks'
            subnotes:
              - 'If you are full HP, wait until the first meteor cast is at 50%
                before popping another sustaining. This way, it''ll last as
                long as it needs to'
          - 'Wait for a double Charybdis cast'
          - note: 'During the first Charybdis:'
            subnotes:
              - Deploy turret
              - Use Reassemble
          - note: 'As soon as the second Charybdis cast starts, begin your
                  burst. Do not forget to refresh sustaining.'
            subnotes:
              - 'There are many variations of this rotation. You have a few
                seconds to spare, so it doesn''t have to be perfect. This is
                what I (Daleven) do, and there is plenty of time to spare'
              - 'Burst 1: Drill > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Hot Shot > Wildfire
                > Hypercharge > (Heatblast x5 with OGCDs in-between) > Split
                Shot'
              - 'Heal: HQ Super Potion > Cancel Food > Second Wind'
              - 'Burst 2: Drill > Hypercharge > (Heatblast/OGCD combo until
                dead)'
      - note: 'Tincture strat involves using a HQ Tincture of Dexterity instead
              in order to kill it before the second meteor hits. Note that
              tinctures share recast timer with health potions, so you cannot
              use both. Any tincture giving +10% dexterity and cappingat 250+
              will work'
        subnotes:
        - note: 'Before you start:'
          subnotes:
            - 'Make sure you are almost full HP. Use Second Wind if needed'
            - 'Make sure sustaining is running and fresh enough to take you to
              full HP'
            - 'Use Tincture (just before Charybdis)'
        - note: 'During first Charybdis:'
          subnotes:
            - 'Deploy turret'
            - 'Use Reassemble'
        - note: 'As soon as the second Charybdis cast starts, begin your
                burst. Rotation:'
          subnotes:
            - '(TODO)'

Welcome to Behemoth's Domain! Lots of easy mobs in the first half, but the last
few floors can get rough. Try to conserve poms as much as possible, but don't
be afraid to blow a flight if you're short on time, or a raging if you get a
floor with a lot of Anzus and Sasquatches, bad debuffs, etc.

Make sure to pop raising immediately, assuming you either have 3 or are not
confident in your ability to clear the set.
