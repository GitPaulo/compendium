      - 'Douse: telegraphed pointblank AoE that leaves behind a puddle. Puddle
        grants haste and attack bonus to the boss. Standing in puddle does NOT
        hurt you.'

    Electrogenesis safely'
  - 'If you''re kiting, it is a good idea to try to pull the boss to the same
    place every time for Douse. If they''re all stacked in one place, it''s
    much easier to keep the boss out of them, reducing damage taken'
  - 'If not kiting, simply pull him out of the puddle after Douse'

There are some hard-hitting dinosaurs here, but it's mostly easier than the
previous set.
