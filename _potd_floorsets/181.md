boss_notes:
  - note: 'Rotation:'
    subnotes:
      - 'Scalding Scolding: strong cleave'
      - note: 'Remedy Bomb spawns along with several untargetable Giddy Bombs'
        subnotes:
          - 'Remedy Bomb starts using Hypothermal Combustion immediately with a
            long cast time. It must be killed before this goes off to prevent
            massive roomwide damage'
          - 'Giddy Bombs all use Hypothermal Combustion after a few seconds.
            Theirs is a small telegraphed pointblank AoE with a short cast
            time, so stay away from them'
      - 'Sap: telegraphed circle AoE'
      - 'Sap'
      - 'Sap'
      - 'Scalding Scolding'
      - 'Sap'
      - note: 'Lava Bomb spawns along with several Giddy Bombs as the boss
        starts casting Massive Burst.'
        subnotes:
          - 'Massive Burst will do 99% max HP damage to everyone if it
            finishes'
          - 'Lava Bomb does a pointblank AoE that can interrupt the boss''s
            Massive Burst. It can be moved around by attacking it'
          - 'Giddy Bombs are the same as before, and can get in the way of your
            attempts to move the Lava Bomb if you''re not prepared'
  - 'Full rotation takes 1 minute, 20 seconds'
  - 'DO NOT open with lust if soloing, as the cleave at the start will destroy
    you'
  - 'The safest time to use lust is during the triple Sap cast. Kill the Remedy
    Bomb as quickly as possible to maximize your time. DO NOT get greedy here.
    Drop transfiguration immediately regardless of stacks after the third Sap,
    as you need to be prepared for the cleave that follows'
  - note: 'Remedy Bomb and Lava Bomb spawn locations are static. Knowing the
    spawn locations of Lava Bombs is especially useful, as you can then pull
    the boss to where it will spawn, allowing you to to keep uptime on the boss
    instead of running around to position the bomb'
    subnotes:
      - note: 'Remedy Bomb spawns are in these locations, and in this order,
        usually roughly half-way between the center and edge of the arena:'
        subnotes:
          - 'north'
          - 'south'
          - 'south (closer to center)'
          - 'south'
          - 'south-east'
          - 'west'
      - note: 'Lava Bomb spawns are in these locations, and in this order,
        roughly half-way between the center and edge of the arena:'

boss_job_specifics:
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '7:00 with strength and 2 lusts'
    notes:
      - 'Steel required'
      - 'Strength highly recommended, else you may need to use 2 steels'
      - 'Use all your lusts, as they''re not really useful for 191+'
      - 'Keep sustaining pots up 100%'
      - 'Good to use Tactician or Sprint for cleaves'
      - note: 'Save Reassemble Drill for Remedy Bombs to give yourself lots of
        time to apply lust stacks during triple Sap'
        subnotes:
          - 'First Remedy Bomb is 12 seconds after pull'
          - 'Full boss rotation takes 1 minute, 20 seconds'
      - note: 'Positioning the boss where Lava Bombs will spawn is easiest'
        subnotes:
          - 'Alternately, you can position the boss in the middle and move
            quickly to knock the Lava Bomb into him, maybe using Sprint for
            extra safety. This costs you some uptime on the boss though'
      - 'DO NOT use Ricochet or turret during Lava Bomb as you risk knocking it
        away from the boss'
