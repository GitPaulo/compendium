There are a lot of proximity mobs here, and a lot of undead. Everything except
swarms, roselets, and hippogryphs can be killed quickly with resolution. Just
make sure to save one or more for the boss. Watch out for the
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-81-109).

These are the last of the storyline floors.
