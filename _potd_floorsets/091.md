boss_notes:
  - note: 'Summon Darkness: spawns corse adds; used when boss hits certain HP points:'
    subnotes:
    - '90% HP: spawns 2 adds'
    - '63% HP: spawns 2 adds'
    - '40% HP: spawns 3 adds'
  - 'Abyss: instant circle AoE'
  - 'Shackle: telegraphed wide line AoE'
  - 'Doom: telegraphed huge conal AoE; applies doom; used immediately after
    summoning the final set of adds'
  - 'Lust can be used to AoE the adds down quickly (3 hits) while also applying
    vulnerability stacks to the boss'
  - 'Adds remain on the battlefield when killed, and will be resurrected after
    a while if not cleared with resolution'
  - 'Resolution can be used to kill adds in one shot. It can also be used on
    the corpses to remove them from the battle, preventing them from
    resurrecting'
  - 'You''ll want to use at least one resolution to clear most, if not all, of
    the adds. They are likely to overwhelm you otherwise'
boss_job_specifics:
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '4m with strength, 1 lust, and 1 resolution (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Steel recommended'
      - note: '1 Lust, 1 Reso Strategy:'
        subnotes:
          - 'Steel and strength both required for this strategy'
          - 'Take boss down to 90% (first summon)'
          - 'Use Sustaining Potion and Lust'
          - 'Stay near boss to gather adds. Spam lust until adds go down, get
          back up, and go down again'
          - 'Drop lust, heal up, and take boss down to 66-67% (just before second
          summon)'
          - 'Use Sustaining Potion and Resolution'
          - 'Spam resolution to remove the existing corpses, kill the next set
          of adds, and remove their corpses as well'
          - 'Drop resolution and take boss down to 40% slowly - hold your
          gauges'
          - 'As soon as boss hits 40%, use burst and kill it ASAP. Kite and
          ignore the adds. Will require some healing, but not too rough'
      - 'Burning an extra resolution or two can make this easier, and you are
      likely to get them back before they''re needed anyway'
  PLD:
    timing:
      - '7m45s with 1 resolution. Ignored first adds until second set spawned,
      then clearing all with resolution. Ignored the last set (6.0)'
      - '6m15s with strength and 1 resolution used at 45% to clear all adds
      (6.0)'
      - '5m30s with strength, 1 lust spammed from first summon until first adds
      die, get up, and die again, 1 resolution spammed for full duration
      starting at second summon, ignoring last set of adds (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Can be cleared with 1 resolution only, but it''s not comfortable and
      not recommended. There''s no need to be so conservative at this level, so
      use steel at least to make it easy. Toss in a strength and/or lust to
      make it faster'
  WAR:
    timing:
      - '5m15s with strength, steel, 1 lust, 1 resolution strategy (6.10)'
    notes:
      - note: 'Recommended strategy: strength, steel, 1 lust, 1 resolution'
        subnotes:
          - 'Ignore first adds until 65%'
          - 'Use a Sustaining Potion, Rampart, and lust at 65% and spam for
          full duration'
          - 'Damage boss down to 45%, then use Sustaining Potion, Vengeance,
          and resolution. Use to kill and clear all adds, including the third
          set that will spawn after a few hits on the boss'
          - 'Drop resolution and finish off the boss'

There are a lot of proximity mobs here, and a lot of undead. Everything except
swarms, roselets, and hippogryphs can be killed quickly with resolution. Just
make sure to save one or more for the boss. Watch out for the
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-81-109).

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 99.

These are the last of the storyline floors.
