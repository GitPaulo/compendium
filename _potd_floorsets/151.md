Some good news:

* No more surprise patrols! There are very few walls, so visibility is great
  the rest of the way.
* Gold sacks drop now. Use your Intuition poms ASAP, but do be careful walking
  into rooms to collect - luring traps are getting scarier and scarier!
  * Some people prefer not to risk collecting hoards, but it is safer if you've
    used safety or sight or already hit a trap in the room

Imps and Soulflayers are the enemies to watch out for here.

Be aware of the [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-151-199) on these floors.
