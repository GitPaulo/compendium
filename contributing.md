Have corrections or additional knowledge to share? Great! There are several
ways to contribute to the Compendium.

## Make a Pull Request

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

If you can make the changes yourself, submitting a pull request is easiest for
me! If it's a large change or you're not sure it'll be accepted for some
reason, it would be best to open an issue or contact me on Discord before you
spend the time on it.

## Contact me on Discord

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

If you don't have and don't want to make a GitHub account, that's ok too. Feel
free to PM me on Discord with any suggestions.
