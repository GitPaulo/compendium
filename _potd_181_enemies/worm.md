    description: 'instant circle AoE used out of combat. Be very careful if
    there are several worms nearby as getting hit by a few of these at once
    could kill you'
notes:
  - 'Enrages after 30 seconds - does draw-in and a pointblank AoE. Knockback
    immunity does not work, but draw-in will not work on floors with knockback
    penalty, making them easier to deal with. The draw-in can also be
    out-ranged, but it''s big'
  - 'Can appear on any floor from 181-189, but seems fairly rare in the earlier
    floors, and more common in the later floors'

      bad'
