## Aetherpool

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">
Before going into the more challenging floors, you'll want to have a
decently-levelled aetherpool arm and armor. These cap out at 99 each, and can
be raised by opening silver chests and defeating certain bosses. As your
aetherpool levels rise, the chance of getting upgrades from silver chests in
lower-level floors decreases, so you need to go to deeper floors to have a
better chance.

### Levelling Aetherpool

**PotD**: There's no easily-spammable floorset that gives guaranteed upgrades, so
you'll want to go for silver chests. You can spam 51-60 in matched groups until
the rate of upgrades gets bad. After that, it's fastest to go to the highest
levels you can as a group. Another option is to go up to floor 100 with matched
groups. Soloing as far as you can also works, and while it will be more
difficult with low aetherpool levels, it will still be good experience.

**HoH**: Beating floor 30 always gives +1 to both arm and armor, so it's
easiest to just spam floor 21-30 in a party or matched groups. Bonus: you'll
also be farming potsherds this way.

When playing with matched groups, it's nice to mention that you're going for
silver chests, and also make sure not to slow down the group too much.

## Regen Potions

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">
Sustaining Potions in PotD and Empyrean Potions in HoH grant a potent regen
effect. These are extremely helpful to soloing especially, and you will want to
have a lot of them going into a difficult floorset. Get them by trading
potsherds to an NPC outside the dungeon.

### Farming Potsherds

**PotD**: In a party, bronze chest drops go to random players, so it's best to
farm potsherds solo. Since deeper floors have a better chance of potsherd
drops, you'll want to start on floor 51 and solo as far as you can without
using many sustaining potions. Preferably use a job that doesn't require many
sustaining potions, such as a tank, physical ranged, or red mage.

**HoH**: Beating floor 30 always gives you a potsherd, so it's easiest to just
spam floor 21-30 in a party or matched groups.

## Other Items

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">
### HP Potions

Potions are great to have in deep dungeons as an extra heal. The best potion to
use depends on your max HP, so will mainly be based on your level, job, and
food. In the early floors of PotD, the type of potion that's dropping from the
floor you're on is likely sufficient. By the time you hit 60, you'll want to
use either Max or Super Potions, depending on your job. Note that Super Potions
do not drop in PotD even though they are best for some jobs in the later
floors. You will get tons of Super Potions from HoH.

| Type (HQ) | Heals | Max | Best until Max HP |
| :--- | :---: | --: | ----------------: |
| Potion | 40% | 200 | 500 |
| Hi-Potion | 40% | 440 | 1,257 |
| Mega-Potion | 35% | 840 | 2,800 |
| X-Potion | 30% | 1300 | 4,333 |
| Max-Potion | 30% | 2400 | 9,600 |
| Super-Potion | 25% | 3600 | n/a |

### Food

The main benefit you'll get from food is the increased HP. Use any
Shadowbringers food that gives +10% VIT for maximum effect. Substats are all
fairly low in deep dungeons, so the other effects from food are fairly minor.

### Stat Potions

Tinctures can be useful for a temporary damage boost, which is especially
useful to tanks. Just note that they share a cooldown with HP potions.

### Misc

* Echo Drops: Can cure silence from impeding traps
* Phoenix Down: Good to have if you're in a party. These drop from bronze
  chests in the earlier floors of both PotD and HoH.
